Scientific Calculator (Tkinter GUI)
Project Overview

This project is a Python-based scientific calculator with a graphical user interface built using Tkinter.
It supports both basic arithmetic operations and advanced scientific functions. The calculator is designed to be user-friendly, compact, and functional, making it a great addition to any developer portfolio.

Features

- Basic arithmetic: +, -, *, /

- Advanced operations: sin(), cos(), tan(), log(), sqrt(), ^ (exponentiation)

- Parentheses support for complex expressions

- Interactive GUI for smooth input and output

- Error handling for invalid operations

Installation

1- Make sure Python 3.x is installed.

2- Install Tkinter if not already available (usually included with Python).

3- Clone this repository:

git clone https://github.com/YSRFTH/Scientific-Calculator-Tkinter-GUI-.git

Running the App

You can run the calculator in two ways:

1. Python Script: 
python scientific_calculator.py

2. Executable File

Double-click "ScientificCalculator.exe" to launch the app (precompiled for Windows).

How to Use

1- Click buttons or type numbers and operators in the input field.

2- Use scientific function buttons (sin, cos, tan, log, sqrt) with parentheses.

3- Press = to calculate the result.

4- Press C to clear the input.
